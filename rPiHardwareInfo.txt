Hardware Information
Raspberry pi Model B+ 512MB
Current Draw:
Uses total between 600mA and 2000mA depending on what devices are connected
to it. For example a wifi dongle, camera module, etc..

I am using a power supply to supply power to it.
5.1V 1A (1000ma) microUSB
I should upgrade this to a 2A power supply.

Relay board Information
8 Channel 
5.0V 2.5A DC
each relay sinks 15-20mA driver current so for 8 total that would
be 20mA * 8relays = 160mA
I will be feeding this board with it's own dedicated external power supply rated at
5.0V 2.5A DC

A gpio pin's current load is 16mA max.
